<b>What is an exception?</b><br>
=> an exception is a runtime error. <br>
=> An exception is a abnormal condition that a rises in a code sequence at run time.<br>
statement 1; <br> 
statement 2; <br> 
statement 3; <br> //exception occur
statement 4; <br> 
statement 5; <br> 
statement 6; <br> 
statement 7; <br> 

=> If a exception rise in Statement three then the up next statement will not be working so that's why we need exception handling   <br>
